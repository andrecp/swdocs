# Must Have

# Should have
* Logging in requests
* Write tests
* handlers: Do not return the raw error as it can expose backend sensitive data

# Nice to have
* Date shouldn't be in UTC for the clients (CLI/browser), for the browser with no javascript!
* Search improvements -- Indexes to improve the queries, do not do a like % by default if no filter param is given
* How can we re-use CLI args between the different subcommands? For example the URL.
