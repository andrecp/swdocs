# Must Have

# Should have
* Logging in requests
* Write tests
* The templates folder at runtime need to be configurable
* handlers: Do not return the raw error as it can expose backend sensitive data

# Nice to have
* Date shouldn't be in UTC for the clients (CLI/browser), for the browser with no javascript!
* Index on updated to speed up queries?!
* How can we re-use CLI args between the different subcommands? For example the URL.
