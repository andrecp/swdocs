# Must Have
* Command line interface get/search
* Have a list of "related" swdocs that is rendered if exists

# Should have
* Logging in requests
* Write tests
* The templates folder at runtime need to be configurable
* handlers: Do not return the raw error as it can expose backend sensitive data

# Nice to have
* Index on updated to speed up queries?!
