* handlers: Do not return the raw error as it can expose backend sensitive data
* Error handling in general, requests timeouts, contexts, etc.
* Logging in requests
* Write tests
* The templates folder at runtime need to be configurable
* It is erroring silently when no .env file
* Index on updated to speed up queries?!
